## **Project Overview**
This interactive website utilizes "scrollytelling" techniques to explore the migration patterns and climate sensitivities of two bird species: the Eared Grebe and the American White Pelican. These species rely heavily on the Great Salt Lake for survival, and the website provides an in-depth examination of their movement dynamics and population distributions in relation to climate events.

Through the interactive interface, users can dive into data that uncovers the intricate connections between climate events (like El Ni単o and La Ni単a) and the challenges these birds face due to changing environmental conditions.

The site emphasizes the ecological significance of the Great Salt Lake, offering users essential insights into the fragile balance between its wildlife and the environment. Through data storytelling, it illustrates the intricate connections between local and regional climate events and the species that depend on this unique ecosystem.

## **Key Features**
**Scrollytelling:** As users scroll through the website, data visualizations and dynamic charts appear, presenting a deeper understanding of the relationship between climate anomalies, bird abundance, migration movements, and the Great Salt Lake ecosystem.

**Simulations:** The website includes interactive simulations that model the influence of global climate events (like El Ni単o and La Ni単a) as well as local climatic factors on the movement dynamics of both species.

**Interactive Story:** The story encourages users to explore the connections between climate data and wildlife conservation, helping them visualize how climate change and climate anomalies impact species survival.
