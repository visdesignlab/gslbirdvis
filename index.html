        <p> <span style="font-size: 16; line-height: 1;"> T</span>he Great Salt Lake is a prominent stopping point for over 10 million birds year-round. Situated 
          on the Pacific Flyway Route, the Great Salt Lake is a top attraction to over 338 species who utilize the lake's resources for breeding, feeding, and temporary 
          habitats during seasonal migration periods. </p> 
        <p>The flight to the Great Salt Lake for these birds has never been questioned, as it is an evolved response to the Great Salt Lake's 
          continuous offering of food and habitat safety. However, as the climate begins to warm, water levels are dropping and food is becoming more scarce. 
        <p>Two species in specific, the <i> Eared Grebe </i> and the <i>American White Pelican</i>, are extremely vulnerable to 
          the environmental deterioration of the lake. With the majority of their continental population coming to the GSL every year, if conditions continue
          to worsen, both of these species are in danger. </p> 
        <p>Here we will investigate the climate effects these birds are vulnerable to as we fly along with them over the years, answering the question, is flying to the Great Salt lake still the flight of least resistance?</p>

          Over an entire year, the Great Salt Lake hosts anywhere from 2 to 5 million Eared Grebes, which at times is almost the entire North American population. 
          As the Grebes travel between Mexico and the Great Salt Lake, the associated climate with these locations largely directs the 
          success of their migration. 

          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
          When the Grebes are wintering in Mexico before making their journey to the GSL, they are heavily dependent on the fish supply available. To complete this long, non-stop journey, 
          they must consume substantial amounts of fish beforehand. 
          </span>

          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            However, fish populations in these Mexican waters can experience significant stress due to climate events, which may impact the Grebes' 
            ability to adequately prepare for their migration.

            One of the key climate changes in Mexico is the fluctuation in ocean temperatures, primarily driven by El Niño and La Niña events.         
          <svg id="eg_climate_svg" 
            viewBox="0 0 900 900" 
            preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"

          </svg>
          <p class = "text-style" id="eg-content2" style="opacity: 0; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease; display: none; ">
            This graph illustrates that El Niño events are linked to rising ocean temperatures, whereas La Niña events are associated with a drop in ocean temperatures.

            <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
              During an El Niño event, the warming of ocean waters negatively impacts fish populations. Fish typically thrive in cooler waters, 
              so when ocean temperatures rise, they are either compelled to migrate to cooler areas or may not survive at all. 
            </span>

            <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
              In response to these sudden adaptations, fish often retreat to deeper, cooler waters where they can more easily thrive. 
              However, this presents a challenge for Grebes, as their small stature limits their diving depth. With fish swimming beyond their 
              maximum foraging depth, Grebes must expend significant energy attempting deeper dives or searching for new feeding grounds where 
              fish remain within reach. 
            </span>

            <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
              The complete opposite occurs during a La Niña. Colder waters during these times allow for fish to thrive extremely well, now able to swim at their usual depth, making for some very happy Grebes.
            </span>

            <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
              Changes in fish populations during climate events directly affect the Grebes, as their survival and migration depend on a steady fish supply. 
              When fish numbers drop during an El Niño, Grebes are forced to adapt to these conditions. 
            </span>

            <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
              These climate shifts may cause Grebes to delay their migration to the Great Salt Lake in the Spring as they try to follow the fish to their 
              new locations in search of food. However, if they are still not adequately fed, their lack of energy might prevent them from even attempting the journey.
            </span>

            <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
              The Great Salt Lake has also undergone significant climate changes, making matters even worse for the Grebes. Not only are they faced with challenges 
              during their wintering period in Mexico, but their time at the lake is becoming more stressful.

          The Great Salt Lake has undergone significant landscape and ecological transformations due to rising local temperatures driven by climate change.

          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
          Illustrated in this graph, the lake has dropped significantly in the past 20 years. To restore the lake to a healthy level, it will take many years of 
          consistent, heavy winters and rainfall to accomplish this. Even with optimal weather patterns, refilling the lake will be slow and uncertain, 
          as the amount of water needed to return it to its previous size and ecological health is immense.  
          </span>

          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            The Great Salt Lake has been a historical attraction to birds solely because of the availability of brine shrimp. Eared Grebes are extremely
            reliant on a healthy brine shrimp supply, needing to consume 28,000 adult brine shrimp daily to survive. This equates to approximately 7-8 hours of 
            foraging a day, which means Grebes need to consume 1 brine shrimp per second in order to meet their dietary needs.  
          </span>

          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            As the water levels at the Great Salt Lake decline, the resulting increase in salinity places significant stress on the brine shrimp populations, which 
            can lead to their decline. Brine shrimp can only survive within a specific salt concentration range, and with this ongoing trend of decreasing lake levels, 
            the rising salinity levels present a serious threat to their survival.         
          </span>

          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            Just like the fish supply in Mexico, the survival of brine shrimp at the Great Salt Lake is closely linked to the well-being of the Grebes. 
            With such a strict dietary plan, any disruption in the availability of these shrimp puts the Grebes in a highly vulnerable position.          
          </span>
          
          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            On top of this, Grebes tend to either stay at the lake through the summer or return in September from a more Northern location they traveled to. 
            Starting around October, Grebes undergo molting, a process in which they shed and regrow feathers. The molting process allows Grebes to grow a new set of 
            feathers and gain weight in preparation for their fall migration back to Mexico.  
          </span>

          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            Because Grebes are flightless during this time, known as the fall-staging period, these birds are entirely dependent on the lake's local food resources. 
            If their immediate environment fails to provide adequate sustenance, they have no alternative 
            food sources and face severe survival challenges.

            Grebes go through a very similar cycle to the fall-staging period 3-6 times each year, during which they become flightless to conserve energy resources. 
            This renders the Grebes flightless for almost 9-10 months each year, the longest flightless period of any bird in the world capable of flight.

            With the Great Salt Lake historically being host to nearly the entire national population of Eared Grebes, these risks are large. 
            Bound to long periods of flightlessness and ongoing food challenges both in Mexico and at the Great Salt Lake, Grebes are facing real

          While the map gives us a helpful way to see how bird movement changes over time, it doesn’t account for how many people were out 
          birdwatching each year. Since birding has grown more popular, more sightings are being reported—not always because there are more 
          birds, but because more people are out looking. This graph helps balance that out by comparing bird sightings to the number of 
          checklists submitted, giving a more accurate view of real population trends.

            This graph displays a clear recent decline in Grebe observations, following a previous trend of increased sightings. These changes

          Here we see similar patterns in 2009 and 2011, but with noticeably fewer species reported in 2009. This dip may be linked to the 2009 El Niño event, which warmed ocean waters and forced fish to retreat to deeper, 
          cooler waters—too deep for Grebes. This likely made feeding far more difficult, leaving the Grebes undernourished and less likely to complete their migration successfully. In contrast, the 2011 La Niña year brought 
          cooler ocean conditions that supported a healthier fish population, improving foraging success and enabling more Grebes to reach the Great Salt Lake.

          This graph shows similar patterns in 2011 and 2015, but with noticeably steeper declines in 2015—likely a response to the extreme El Niño that year. In contrast, the cooler, more stable conditions of the 
          2011 La Niña supported steadier Grebe numbers. These trends highlight how Grebes may be reacting to the heightened instability and harsher impacts of strong El Niño conditions.

            These patterns aren’t just numbers—they tell a story of survival. For Eared Grebes, survival hinges on a delicate balance between climate conditions in Mexico and those at the Great Salt Lake. 
            As climate shifts—like El Niño—alter marine ecosystems, Grebes face disrupted food sources during winter, which directly impacts 
            their ability to complete the migration north in the spring.
          </span>
          
          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            Once at the lake, they are met with another challenge: a drying habitat and a shrinking brine shrimp population. For birds that spend much of the year 
            flightless and bound to the water, these conditions can turn into serious survival threats.
          </span>
          
          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            We may be witnessing the beginning of a shift—Grebes potentially seeking more stable habitats elsewhere. If the lake continues to decline, the Great Salt Lake 
            could lose its role as a vital stopover site for nearly the entire national population of this species.

            Gaining insight into these patterns is a crucial step toward grasping the complex challenges bird species are facing in a changing world — 
            challenges that are deeply connected to the health of entire ecosystems, including our own.

            Here we can visualize the migration flow of the Pelicans over the last 20 years. These Pelicans can stay at the Great Salt Lake year-round, but more commonly 
            come in the Springtime to nest and breed. Prior to their Spring arrival, the Pelicans overwinter in Mexico, soaking up the sun and eating lots of fish before the thousands 
            mile long journey to Utah.

              To successfully complete their migration, Pelicans need to be well-nourished before leaving Mexico — making them heavily dependent on a 
              healthy, abundant fish supply. However, increasingly severe ocean warming has disrupted these conditions, significantly impacting the 
              birds’ ability to feed before their journey to the Great Salt Lake.

            One of the most notable climate shifts in Mexico is the variation in ocean temperatures. These shifts are best represented by the El Niño and La Niña climate events.

            This graph shows that El Niño events are closely associated with rising ocean temperatures, while La Niña events correspond to a decline in ocean temperatures.

            <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
              When the ocean warms during an El Niño event, this has a negative effect on fish populations. Fish survive best in cold water temperatures, 
              so when these above average ocean temperatures are experienced, fish are either forced to migrate elsewhere to colder waters or simply do not survive. 
            </span>

            <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
              The complete opposite occurs during a La Niña. Colder waters during these times allow for fish to thrive extremely well, 
              resulting in some very happy Pelicans. 
            </span>

            <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
              What happens to the fish during these climate events has a cascade effect on the Pelicans, as their survival and migration success is directly dependent on the fish supply. 
              When fish supply is low during an El Niño, Pelicans must evolve to adapt to these changes. 
            </span>

            <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
              Faced with the increased effort required to find available fish, these Pelicans may delay their spring migration to the Great Salt Lake. 
              If Pelicans continue to struggle building up enough energy reserves, they might be discouraged to even attempt the journey — lacking 
              the strength to complete such a demanding trip. 
            </span>

              And, to make matters worse, the Great Salt Lake has also undergone extreme changes due to shifting climates. As a result, not only have the Pelicans experienced challenges on some of their Mexican winter breaks,
              but their Spring and Summer seasons at the Great Salt Lake are becoming increasingly less enjoyable.

            Northern Utah temperatures have increased almost 2 degrees Farenheit since the early 1980s, which has evidently caused declines at the Great Salt Lake. On top of this, 
            inflows from the Bear, Weber, and Jordan rivers have gradually declined over the past 40 years. Not only do these rivers provide water to the lake, but they support 
            the diets of many Pelicans. 
          </span>

          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            The Great Salt Lake has been a historical attraction to birds solely because of the availability of brine shrimp. Yet, Pelicans do not typically consume the brine shrimp supply available at the lake. Their 
            diet mainly consists of fish, which cannot be found in the lake given it's high salty content. These fish are available at freshwater locations, the closest ones being
            the Bear, Weber, and Jordan rivers. If these local rivers do not have sufficient food supply, as a result of low water levels, Pelicans will travel anywhere from 40 to 200 miles to get their fish fix.

          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            As you can see in this graph, the lake has dropped over 5 feet in the past 20 years. While this may not 
            seem like a lot, it will take many years of consistent, heavy winters and rainfall to restore the lake to a healthy, sustainable level. 
            Even with ideal weather patterns, the process of refilling the lake will be slow and uncertain, as the amount of water needed to bring it 
            back to its former size and ecological health is immense.

            Gunnison Island, the Pelicans main hub at the lake, is one of the most visibly affected areas by the declining water levels. 
            The island is no longer a true island or 
            isolated habitat, and is now better denoted as a "land bridge". The shrinking of the lake has connected what was once Gunnison Island with the perimeter of the lake, allowing 
            coyotes and other predators easy access by crossing these land bridges.

            So, what does this mean for the Pelicans? 
          </span>

          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            The degrading health of the lake and the rivers that support it's water levels could discourage Pelicans from continuing to come to the Great Salt Lake. Overcompensating for the lack of food during 
            low elevation years by flying extraneous distances to support their own, and their young's diets can become exhausting. Additionally, increased predation disrupting Pelicans nests adds further stress, 
            making the island a less viable breeding ground. 
          </span>

          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            As ideal weather patterns become less and less hopeful with intensifying effects of climate
            change, hopes of restoring the lake to a healthy level is becoming scarce. For the Pelicans, this means an 
            increasingly uncertain future—without reliable water levels and food sources, their annual return to the Great Salt Lake 
            may soon be too risky or unsustainable to continue.

          While the map gives us a helpful way to see how bird movement changes over time, it doesn’t account for how many people were out 
          birdwatching each year. Since birding has grown more popular, more sightings are being reported—not always because there are more 
          birds, but because more people are out looking. This graph helps balance that out by comparing bird sightings to the number of 
          checklists submitted, giving a more accurate view of real population trends.
  

          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            We can see that bird observations continued to increase from 2004-2012, but following this, we can observe a gradual
            decline throughout the next decade.  
          </span>

          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            These trends are likely linked to the factors we’ve discussed earlier. For example, Pelicans may arrive at the Great Salt
            Lake in poor condition after struggling to find enough food during their time in Mexico. They could also face challenges at 
            the lake itself, like trouble finding food or protecting their nests. It's possible that all these factors are happening 
            together, making the birds’ journey and survival even harder.
          </span>

          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            Let’s take a closer look at some year-to-year comparisons to better understand the challenges Pelicans may be facing, which 
            could explain the recent decline in their population at the Great Salt Lake.

          Here we observe similar trends in 2009 and 2011, though there are fewer species reported in 2009 compared to 2011. This could 
          largely be associated with the 2009 El Niño, which disrupted the fish supply, leading to fewer Pelicans arriving at the Great Salt 
          Lake. 2011, a La Niña year, helped restore healthy conditions for fish, providing better feeding conditions in Mexico for the Pelicans 
          and facilitating their migration to the lake.

          Here, we can see that the numbers in 2010 are still lower compared to 2011. This could be attributed to the Pelicans continuing to 
          struggle with their migration to the Great Salt Lake after the disruptions caused by the 2009 El Niño. However, there is a slight 
          increase in 2010 from 2009, likely reflecting some recovery from the previous year's conditions. 

          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            While 2010 was a La Niña year, the effects of ocean cooling take time to manifest, so the fish population may not have responded immediately. By 2011, during a second La Niña year, 
            the cooler ocean temperatures would have had a more stable and consistent effect on the fish, allowing them to thrive and providing the Pelicans with better feeding conditions. 
            This likely contributed to the increased number of Pelicans arriving at the GSL in 2011.

          The 2015 El Niño was the strongest event seen in the past 20 years. In contrast, 2023 also experienced an El Niño, but during this 8 year period, the Great Salt Lake has experienced rapid decline. 
          While bird numbers were higher in 2015 compared to 2023, the combination of an extreme El Niño and worsening conditions at the lake suggests that Pelicans might truly be becoming increasingly 
          discouraged from migrating to the lake.

          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            With the ongoing deterioration of their habitat and food sources, they may now be forced to look elsewhere for survival, signaling a critical shift in their migratory behavior.

            In summary, the climate teleconnections between the Pelicans' overwintering grounds in Mexico and the Great Salt Lake play a significant role in shaping their migration patterns and survival.
            These complex interactions highlight the vulnerability of these species to climate-driven changes, such as extreme weather events like El Niño and the deterioration of their habitat at the lake.

          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            Pelicans are being pushed to the brink, as the realization they are being climatically threatened is becoming clearer. 
            While these birds have historically relied on the lake as a crucial stopover in their migration, these uncertain changes
            are forcing them to adapt. 
          </span>

          <span class="text-style" style="display: block; margin-top: 3vh; transition: transform 1s ease, opacity 1.5s ease;">
            It is clear that Pelicans may be increasingly finding the Great Salt Lake less suitable as a refuge and might be 
            seeking habitat elsewhere. This potential shift is a sign of the broader impacts of climate change, not only on this 
            species but on many others that depend on delicate ecosystems like the Great Salt Lake.
